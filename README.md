# Notely

Notely is a collaborative Web Application that is designed as a multi-platform, multi-device solution to studentâ€™s online academic needs. It allows users to join groups modelled on their own real-life college or university modules and request, share and download class notes, files and documents with their fellow class mates. These groups also allow class mates to stay up to date with academic events relating to their course group and share updates on their current course work.
Users can brainstorm Ideas organise industry open days, RSVP class parties and plan class study groups and more.
